# Subsystems

Subsystems are an important feature of NextFTC. A Subsystem is a collection of hardware devices and [Commands](../referenceguide/commands.md) that all interact with a discrete aspect of the robot, such as a lift, claw, or arm. 

Generally, the first step when programming a robot is to program your subystems. This guide will walk you through a couple example subsystems that are found on many FTC robots, in order to give you the tools to create your own that fit your needs exactly.
